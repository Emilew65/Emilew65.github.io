            I think this meatloaf recipe is close to my grandmother's meatloaf 
            in flavor and texture. "Nanaw" Rowan made the most delicious 
            meatloaf in the state. When she passed away, she didn't leave me her 
            recipe, but she left me the desire to recreate it, and I think this 
            is it! Don't let the number of ingredients discourage you — it's 
            part of the magic of creating a masterpiece.

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the glaze: Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and cider 
                    vinegar together in a bowl until well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                    (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with 
                    cooking spray or line with aluminum foil for easier 
                    cleanup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine onion and bell pepper in a microwave-safe 
                    container. Cover and microwave until softened, 1 to 2 
                    minutes. Set aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix oats, milk, eggs, garlic, mustard, Worcestershire 
                    sauce, thyme, seasoned salt, black pepper, and hot sauce 
                    together in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in 
                    cooked onion and bell pepper. Add ground beef, pork, and 
                    veal. With gloved hands, work all ingredients together 
                    until completely mixed and uniform.
                </li>
                <li>  
                    Pat 1/2 of the meatloaf mixture into each prepared loaf 
                    pan. Brush each loaf with 1/4 of the glaze; set 
                    remaining glaze aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Remove the 
                    pans from the oven and carefully drain the fat. Brush 
                    remaining glaze over loaves, then return to the oven and 
                    bake for 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the center should read at least 160 
                    degrees F (70 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before 
                    slicing.
                </li>
