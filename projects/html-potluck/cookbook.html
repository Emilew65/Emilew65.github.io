            I think this meatloaf recipe is close to my grandmother's meatloaf 
            in flavor and texture. "Nanaw" Rowan made the most delicious 
            meatloaf in the state. When she passed away, she didn't leave me her 
            recipe, but she left me the desire to recreate it, and I think this 
            is it! Don't let the number of ingredients discourage you — it's 
            part of the magic of creating a masterpiece.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <b>Brown Sugar Glaze:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup ketchup</li> 
                <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li> 
                <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
                <b>Meatloaf:</b>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>½ green bell pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>⅔ cup quick cooking oats</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons prepared mustard</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
                <li>½ pound ground veal</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the glaze: Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and cider 
                    vinegar together in a bowl until well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                    (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with 
                    cooking spray or line with aluminum foil for easier 
                    cleanup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine onion and bell pepper in a microwave-safe 
                    container. Cover and microwave until softened, 1 to 2 
                    minutes. Set aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix oats, milk, eggs, garlic, mustard, Worcestershire 
                    sauce, thyme, seasoned salt, black pepper, and hot sauce 
                    together in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in 
                    cooked onion and bell pepper. Add ground beef, pork, and 
                    veal. With gloved hands, work all ingredients together 
                    until completely mixed and uniform.
                </li>
                <li>  
                    Pat 1/2 of the meatloaf mixture into each prepared loaf 
                    pan. Brush each loaf with 1/4 of the glaze; set 
                    remaining glaze aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Remove the 
                    pans from the oven and carefully drain the fat. Brush 
                    remaining glaze over loaves, then return to the oven and 
                    bake for 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the center should read at least 160 
                    degrees F (70 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before 
                    slicing.
                </li>
            </ol>

            This heaven on earth cake is an easy summer no-bake dessert that can 
            be made up to 2 days ahead. Airy angel food cake cubes are layered 
            with cherry pie filling and rich vanilla pudding, then topped with 
            swirls of whipped topping and more cherry filling.

            Chicken and broccoli casserole is a meal that most people at Team 
            Delish grew up eating, and this recipe is guaranteed to make you 
            feel like a kid again. This creamy, cheesy, Ritz cracker-topped 
            casserole is packed with chicken, rice, and freshly blanched 
            broccoli with the quintessential cream of mushroom soup. This is 
            my ideal Sunday dinner, and it's perfect for when you have a few 
            extra mouths to feed.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN & BROCCOLI Casserole</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Butter:</b>Use unsalted butter instead of salted, as you 
                don't want the dish to be overly salty and you can control the 
                seasonings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Chicken Breast:</b>This casserole is a great way to use up 
                those chicken breasts you have hanging out in the fridge. That 
                being said, you can also use rotisserie chicken. You’ll need a 
                little over a pound of shredded chicken if that's what you 
                choose.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>All-Purpose Seasoning Salt:</b>Even when cooked properly, 
                all of these flavors can read a little bit bland, so for some 
                added kick, I season the chicken with my favorite seasoning 
                salt blend. Lawry’s is a classic, but you can also use your 
                favorite brand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Yellow Onion & Garlic:</b>The base to most of our dishes, an 
                onion and garlic will create flavor from the very start.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Long-Grain White Rice:</b>I highly recommend using white rice 
                instead of swapping it out for another type of rice like brown 
                rice. It will take longer to cook and influence the final 
                texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Chicken Broth:</b>Use low-sodium chicken broth to control the 
                salt amounts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cream Of Mushroom Soup:</b>Cream of mushroom soup is an 
                absolute must for chicken and broccoli casserole. Not only is 
                it easy to find in every grocery store, but it’s also extremely 
                affordable and adds instant creaminess to the dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Broccoli:</b>I'm using fresh broccoli here, but you can use 
                frozen if you prefer! Just thaw it in the microwave and add it 
                to the casserole in step 7.

                <b>Cheddar:</b>For the best possible flavor and texture, I 
                always recommend freshly shredding your cheese when possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ritz Crackers:</b>Buttery Ritz crackers bring a layer of 
                crunch and buttery flavor to the top of the casserole, 
                providing a much-needed textural contrast. Of course, you don’t 
                have to use Ritz, you can grab your favorite brand of buttery 
                crackers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Garlic Powder:</b>Adding a dash of garlic powder to the 
                topping ensures you get a hint of garlic flavor in each bite.

        <h3>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 375° and grease a 13" x 9" pan with butter. 
            Slice the chicken breast into cutlets: This is done the same way 
            you would butterfly a chicken breast, but instead of leaving the 
            two halves connected, finish cutting until the two halves are 
            separated. Season all over with seasoning salt. Heat a large 
            skillet over medium heat. Pour in some oil and swirl to coat the 
            pan. Cook the chicken for about 7 minutes per side or until light 
            golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a plate.

            <br>    
            Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in the same pan. Once the butter is melted, add 
            the onion and 1/2 tsp. salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
            the onion begins to soften, which should take about 5 minutes. Add 
            the garlic and cook 1 minute more, or until garlic is fragrant. Add 
            the rice and stir to evenly combine. Lightly toast the rice, 2 to 3 
            minutes. Add the broth and scrape any browned bits from the bottom 
            of the skillet. Stir in the soup until smooth and combined.
            <br>
            Transfer everything to the prepared pan. Cover the pan with foil 
            and bake, uncovering and stirring halfway through, until the rice 
            is fully cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.

            over high heat. Place ice cubes in a medium bowl and fill with 
            cold water. Add the broccoli to the boiling water and cook until 
            bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.

            In a medium bowl, melt the remaining 2 Tbsp. in the microwave. Add 
            1/2 cup cheese, crackers, garlic powder, and pepper. Toss with a 
            fork to combine.

        <h3>Recipe Tips</h3>
        <br>
        <ul> 
            <li>
                <b>What kind of seasoning salt should I use? </b>Seasoning salt 
                can vary greatly depending on the brand, so use one you’re 
                already familiar with. I developed this recipe using Lawry’s 
                seasoning salt (because I know it like the back of my hand), 
                but if you use another brand, start with 2 tsp., then add more 
                to the finished product if needed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?</b>Brown rice 
                takes significantly longer to cook than white rice. We didn't 
                test this with brown rice, but you are welcome to give it a go, 
                keeping in mind that you will need to cook the rice longer in 
                step 3, adding more liquid as you go.
            </li>

            <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>4 (6-oz.) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>
                1 Tbsp. all-purpose seasoning salt (such as Lawry’s or 
                Adobo)
            </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. neutral oil </li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped </li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice, rinsed </li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth </li>
            <li>2 (10-oz.) cans cream of mushroom soup </li>
            <li>2 heads of broccoli, cut into florets</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups crushed Ritz crackers</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. garlic powder </li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 375°. Grease a 
                13" x 9" baking dish with butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice chicken lengthwise into thin cutlets; season all over 
                with seasoning salt. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 
                oil; swirl to coat pan. Working in batches if needed, add 
                chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until light golden 
                brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest 
                part registers 165°, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a 
                cutting board.
            </li>
            <li>
                In same skillet over medium heat, melt 2 Tbsp. butter. Add 
                onion; season with 1/2 tsp. salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 
                cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add rice 
                and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until rice is 
                lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add broth and scrape any 
                browned bits from bottom of skillet. Stir in soup. Transfer to 
                prepared baking dish. Cover dish with foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake rice mixture, stirring halfway through, until rice is 
                almost completely cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Start 
                checking for doneness at around 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a 
                boil. Place ice cubes in a medium bowl and fill with cold 
                water. Cook broccoli in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                until bright green and slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Transfer broccoli to ice water to stop cooking. Transfer 
                broccoli to a plate; season with 1/2 tsp. salt.
            </li>
            <li>Shred chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>
                In a medium heatproof bowl, microwave remaining 2 Tbsp. butter 
                until melted, about 30 seconds. Add crackers, garlic powder, 
                pepper, and 1/2 cup cheese and toss with a fork to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uncover dish and stir in chicken, broccoli, and remaining 1 cup 
                cheese. Top with cracker topping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to bake casserole, uncovered, until broccoli is tender 
                and topping is slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let 
                cool slightly. 
            </li>
