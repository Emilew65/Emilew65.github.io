            <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            In London, MI6 agent Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby) and her team 
            attempt to retrieve a programmable super-virus dubbed "Snowflake" 
            from techno-terrorist organization Eteon. Brixton Lore (Idris Elba) 
            is an ex-MI6 Agent turned Eteon operative with cybernetic implants 
            that allow him to perform superhuman feats. He arrives and kills 
            all the agents except Hattie, who injects the only dose of 
            Snowflake into herself before escaping. Brixton frames Hattie for 
            killing her team and stealing Snowflake, forcing her to go on the 
            run.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ex-DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and ex-MI6 Agent Deckard 
            Shaw (Jason Statham) are informed of the missing virus and 
            reluctantly work together to track it down. Luke is estranged from 
            his Samoan family and Shas has not seen his sister for a while. 
            Locke (Ryan Reynolds) is the CIA agent who briefs Luke about the 
            virus in front of Luke's daughter Sam. Locke tells Luke about how 
            Hattie went rogue with the virus. After a brief meeting at a CIA 
            black site at the Leadenhall Building (where Hobbs and Shaw refuse 
            to work with each other under any circumstances), Deckard goes to 
            Hattie's apartment for information, only to get attacked by Eteon 
            operatives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile Hobbs manages to find Hattie (he knows Hattie is MI-6 
            and looks for her in the streets not covered by CCTV cameras); 
            after a brief scuffle, he brings her to the CIA offices. As Deckard 
            arrives, he informs him that she is actually his sister. Hattie 
            reveals that the virus is inside her. The office is attacked, and 
            Hattie is taken by Brixton, whom Deckard recognizes as an old 
            colleague-turned-enemy he believes killed by him. Hobbs and 
            Deckard pursue and rescue Hattie, and during an ensuing car chase, 
            evade Brixton, who crashes into a double-Decker bus. However, 
            Brixton frames all three as traitors via Eteon's control of global 
            news media.
            <br>
            <br>
            The three locate Snowflake's creator, Professor Andreiko (Eddie 
            Marsan) (he buys his Russian newspaper from the same newsstand 
            every morning), where they learn he purposed it to efficiently 
            deliver vaccines. To prevent Eteon from using it to eradicate 
            humanity, Hattie, while the virus is still dormant (in the next 42 
            hrs the capsules inside Hattie will dissolve, releasing the virus. 
            At this point it will go airborne. Global contamination within a 
            week. The virus cannot be reprogrammed inside a host), must either 
            be cremated or have the virus removed with a specialized extraction 
            device, which is located in Eteon's special facility in Chernobyl, 
            Ukraine. Andreiko had created the virus as a creator of vaccines,
            but Eteon betrayed him and used his work for global terrorism 
            instead. Eteon wants to eliminate the weakest humans, the ones not 
            fit for Eteon's vision of humanity (the perfect being). Meanwhile 
            Eteon's unknown director is giving constant upgrades to Brixton's 
            implants to make him stronger and faster. He also tells Brixton 
            that he wants Hobbs and Shaw working for Eteon's cause.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although Hobbs was briefly detained due to Deckard making his fake 
            alias "Mike Oxmaul," the three manage to travel to Moscow. 
            Andreiko is abducted by Brixton and not Brixton that the trio is 
            coming to Ukraine. After rendezvousing with Deckard's former flame 
            Margarita (Eiza Gonz√°lez) to rearm in Moscow, the three infiltrate 
            the facility. As per plan Margarita delivers Hattie to Brixton, who 
            takes her right to the extraction machine. Meanwhile Hobbs and 
            Shaw attack the facility from the air. Hobbs and Shaw are captured 
            by Brixton and his men and tortured with electrical shocks. Using 
            this diversion, Hattie disarms her guards and escapes with the 
            extraction machine and Andreiko. Hattie then launches a 
            counter-attack to rescue Hobbs and Shaw from Brixton. They retrieve 
            the device before escaping in a truck during the facility's 
            destruction, though Andreiko is killed, and the device is damaged.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hobbs takes Deckard and Hattie to his childhood home in Samoa to 
            visit his estranged brother Jonah (Cliff Curtis), a talented 
            mechanic, to repair the device and lay low off the grid before 
            confronting Brixton's forces again. Hobbs has a tense reunion with 
            his family as he had turned his father to the authorities prior 
            (His father wanted Luke and Jonah to enter the burglary business 
            with him, but only Hobbs was able to see through his lies. He was 
            OK with putting Luke and Jonah's life in danger and so Luke turned 
            him in), but their mother convinces Jonah to help.
            <br>    
            <br>
            The makeshift battalion prepares for Eteon's arrival, disabling 
            the weapons used by Eteon's team by temporarily shutting down their 
            authorization code, and setting up a variety of traps around the 
            island. Jonah successfully repairs the device and starts the virus 
            extraction just as Brixton and his army arrive.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the ensuing battle, the Samoans engage and easily overpower 
            Brixton's reinforcements while suffering minimal casualties. 
            Brixton recaptures Hattie with a helicopter; however, Hobbs, 
            Deckard, and the Samoans bring the aircraft down with several 
            custom trucks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Working together, Hobbs and Deckard alternate their attacks to 
            defeat Brixton, who is remotely terminated afterward by Eteon's 
            unseen director. The director sends a message claiming to know 
            Hobbs and intending to persuade him and the Shaw siblings, while 
            they promise to find the director; the group then celebrates their 
            victory.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hobbs brings his daughter Sam Hobbs (Eliana Su'A) to meet their 
            extended family in Samoa; Deckard and Hattie are implied to bust 
            their mother Magdalene "Queenie" Shaw (Helen Mirren) out of prison; 
            and Hobbs receives a call from his partner, Locke, who has broken 
            into a laboratory and discovered a more threatening virus. Hobbs 
            also secretly has the London police set on Deckard in retaliation 
            for the "Mike Oxmaul" prank, which Hobbs told the police that 
            Deckard's name was "Hugh Janus"

            <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) instructs Po (Jack Black) on how to 
            teach an introductory Kung Fu lesson to a group of rambunctious 
            bunny children. Shifu warns that this is Po's toughest challenge 
            yet, much more challenging than any other furious monster he has 
            faced in battle. Shifu asks Po not to use the Wuxi finger hold on 
            the kids. He says that each generation has to teach the next, so 
            the art of Kung Fu lives on.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shifu leaves, and Po is in charge, but none of the bunny kids are 
            listening to Po. Po rings the gong to gain their attention. The 
            bunny kids are only excited to learn the cool Kung Fu moves, so 
            they can fight like the Dragon Warrior.
            <br>
            <br>
            Po tries to teach the kids that combat is only part of what Kung Fu 
            is about and that its true meaning is "excellence of self". To 
            illustrate his point, he explains the Furious Five's individual 
            backstories, and the basic philosophical concepts that enabled 
            them to be great Kung Fu masters. Po says that it wasn't their 
            fighting abilities that made them amazing, and that each of them 
            had to learn the secrets of Kung Fu before they became the great 
            warriors that they are.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mantis (Max Koch), as a youth, was a petulantly impatient warrior, 
            prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. 
            The world was too slow for Mantis, and he was too fast. One day a 
            sheep approached Mantis and asked for help to retrieve their wool 
            coats that were stolen by Crocodile Bandits. The sheep tried to 
            give Mantis a map of their lair, but Mantis dismissed it, even 
            though the sheep said that the bandits were notorious for setting 
            traps. Mantis' habits got him captured by crocodile bandits. 
            Mantis was imprisoned in a steel cage, and no matter how hard he 
            tried, he could not free himself. The lengthy wait that Mantis was 
            forced to endure in his prison taught him patience, and he was 
            able to use this to play dead long enough to ambush his captors. 
            With patience, Mantis evolved into an even more fearsome warrior.

            The viper clan descended from the mighty dragons. The flames of 
            the dragons were distilled into the viper's powerful venom. Great 
            Master Viper was the greatest viper warrior of his clan. One drop 
            of his venom would kill 15 gorillas and 1 mid-sized crocodile. 
            Viper (Jessica DiCicco), the daughter of Great Master Viper (James 
            Sie), was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on 
            his venomous bite to protect the village, believed that she could 
            never be a warrior like him, causing Viper to grow up shy and 
            timid. The little Viper took up ribbon dancing to make her father 
            smile. Viper blossomed into the best ribbon dancer in the village. 
            One night during the Moon Festival, Great Master Viper encountered 
            a gorilla bandit (John DiMaggio) and broke his fangs on the 
            gorilla's special snake-proof armor. Seeing her father in peril, 
            Viper found the courage to fight the bandit and defeat him with her 
            ribbon dancing skills. Viper realizes that she does not have to 
            bite to be able to fight. Viper tangles the Gorilla Bandit in her 
            ribbons and renders him captive. That night Viper found courage, 
            which is a weapon far more potent than venom.

            Crane (David Cross) was the self-deprecating janitor of a Kung Fu 
            academy until star pupil Mei Ling (Stephanie Lemelin) encouraged 
            him to seek enrollment by participating at the upcoming tryouts. 
            Mei had seen glimpses of Crane's skills with the broom when he went 
            about cleaning the academy. Based on Mei's encouragement, Crane 
            started to train for the tryouts every night. Crane's lifelong 
            belief that he was too skinny to be an effective Kung Fu warrior
            caused him to lose his nerve at the tryouts. To pass the tryouts, 
            the candidates had to pass an obstacle course and grab a red flag 
            at the end of it. However, when he accidentally stumbled into the 
            intense obstacle course to determine eligibility, he discovered the 
            confidence to use his skinniness as an asset and pass the test. 
            Crane gained his confidence back.

            Tigress (Tara Strong) was an orphan, and unfairly isolated as a 
            "monster" because of her lack of control of her ferocity and 
            strength. Due to this Tigress was never adopted by a family. 
            She was not like the other fuzzy bunnies and the cute little 
            ducks, and her simple movements caused tremendous damage. Tigress 
            had no idea how strong she was. At the behest of the orphanage 
            staff, Shifu arrived to teach her the discipline that she 
            desperately needed to control her movements, and the other children 
            eventually trusted and befriended her. Despite this breakthrough, 
            no adult would consent to adopt her as they were still very afraid 
            of her, so Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter.

            <br>
            Monkey (Jaycee Chan) was humiliated in his youth and grew up 
            tormenting his village with pranks as revenge. The villagers asked 
            Monkey to leave, but he refused, so they decided to force him to 
            leave. Many challengers attempted to drive him away, but Monkey 
            would always remove their pants to humiliate them. Master Oogway 
            (Randall Duk Kim), who had a shell instead of pants, was able to 
            subdue Monkey, and saved him from being crushed by a column knocked 
            loose in their brawl. Oogway realized that Monkey's rage came from 
            the events in his past, when he was ridiculed by the villagers. 
            Noticing his reaction to being cared about, Oogway told Monkey that 
            he could stay in the village as long as he would show others the 
            compassion that he so greatly desired. Oogway asks Monkey to use 
            his skills for the good of the village.
            <br>

            Shifu returns, anticipating finding a lack of progress, and is 
            surprised to see he has underestimated Po's talents again. When the 
            Bunnies ask Po how his first day of Kung Fu was, Po has a 
            flashback to all the unpleasant events of his first day of Kung Fu 
            training. He smiles confidently and assures them that "it was 
            awesome!".

            <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            17-year-old Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a social outcast from 
            Alabama in his high school in Oro Valley, Arizona with a passion 
            for vehicles. His parents got divorced when he was a 3-year-old, 
            and he has a police record due to reckless driving with 2 offenses. 
            To avoid solitary confinement, him and his mom move a lot, 
            resulting in Sean's lack of friendship.
            <br>
            <br>
            One afternoon, after school, a local rich student named Clay 
            (Zachary Ty Bryan), who is the captain of their school's football 
            team which calls themselves "The Ducks", mocks Sean's built 1971 
            Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Sean insults him about his "daddy's Viper", 
            which causes Clay to burst, and while Sean is driving away, he 
            uses a baseball to shatter the rear windshield of Sean's Monte 
            Carlo. Soon, an angry Sean challenges Clay to a street race, to 
            which Sean wants to race only for Pink slips. After some 
            retaliation, Clay's girlfriend, Cindy, offers herself as the prize.
            <br>
            <br>
            The racetrack is then officially declared which is a construction 
            site for a new suburbia scheduled for creation. The start gets 
            atrocious for Sean, and Clay is in the lead. Sean drives through an
            alley to catch up with Clay, and he drives through an unfinished 
            house. He passes Clay, who retaliates by trying to ram him off the 
            road, damaging his Viper in the process. Sean T-bones Clay and he 
            crashes into a cement pipe, but Sean loses control, and he flips 
            over several times, totaling his Monte Carlo. Later on, Clay and 
            Sean are both convicted for illegal street racing and property 
            damage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because of his numerous brushes with the law in the past, and also  
            tired of moving away all the time, Sean's mom sends him to Tokyo, 
            to live with his dad, who is stationed as a United States Navy 
            officer. Upon arriving at his dad's home in Tokyo, he is warned by 
            his dad not to stir up any trouble, and to not go anywhere near a 
            vehicle or he'll get deported back to the United States to go to 
            jail there, as he had already committed the maximum of 3 criminal 
            offenses.
            <br>
            <br>
            At his new high school, Sean is an outcast like before, but he 
            meets Twinkie (Bow Wow), an extremely business-minded fellow 
            American immigrant, who sells Pre-owned goods around the school, 
            and he drives a custom-designed, but odd Hulk-themed 2004 
            Volkswagen Touran van. Twinkie introduces Sean to the drift racing 
            scene in Tokyo, at the parking lot reserved for street racers and 
            audience. On the lot, Sean has a verbal confrontation with Takashi 
            (Brian Tee) - also known as "Drift King" or DK, because he was 
            talking to his girlfriend, Neela (Nathalie Kelley), whom he met 
            earlier in school.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the confront, Takashi challenges Sean to the illegal street 
            race, and Han Seul-Oh (Sung Kang), Takashi's friend and business 
            partner, lends him his Nissan Silvia S-15 but due to Sean's lack of 
            knowledge on how to drift, he is defeated by Takashi's Nissan 350Z 
            and his skills, and destroys the Silvia. After the race, Han warns 
            him not to leave town. As he returns home, his father confronts 
            him, and they have an argument, but eventually Sean agrees to stay 
            away from racing. The next day, Han meets Sean after school, who is 
            now driving an orange-black 1994 Mazda RX-7 FD and he tells him 
            that he must work for him to repay the damaging his vehicle.
            <br>
            <br>
            Han ends up Sean's friend and teaches him to drift, giving him a 
            Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX (with the WRC tuning) to represent 
            Han in future races. Han explains to him that he is helping him 
            because Sean is the only one who is unafraid of Takashi (calling 
            him DK's "kryptonite"), and Han explains that he arrived in Tokyo 
            to prevent conviction also and says Tokyo "is his Mexico". Sean 
            leaves his dad's house and bunks with Han, and soon masters 
            drifting and gains some reputation after racing Morimoto and 
            winning against him. One evening when Neela and Sean go on a date, 
            explaining her story; she is an outsider, and her mom arrived in 
            Tokyo from Australia after high school, working as a barmaid, and 
            after she died when she was ten years old, DK's grandparents took 
            her in, and she hooked up with DK. DK beats up Sean the next day, 
            telling him to stay away from Neela, or "the only thing he will be 
            driving is a wheelchair". Angry after seeing Sean's bruises, Neela 
            leaves Takashi, moving into Han's garage.
            <br>
            <br>
            One evening, Takashi's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba), a local Yakuza 
            high-ranking member, visits him at his small storage room next to 
            his cover-up betting shop. Kamata informs Takashi that the business 
            is going far less than expectations, and Takashi realizes that Han 
            has been nabbing a few of his merchandise, as Kamata departs. Later 
            that night, Takashi and Morimoto arrive at Han's garage and 
            confront Han, Sean, and Neela about the goods, and Takashi pulls 
            out his weapon and threatened to shoot at Han. Twinkie causes a 
            distraction, and Han, Sean and Neela use the moment to escape from 
            the garage, with Morimoto and Takashi in close pursuit.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 4 are driving throughout the Tokyo community, with Han in the 
            lead, behind him Sean and Neela, with Morimoto and Takashi closing 
            up to them. Morimoto closes up and tries to T-bone Sean over the 
            road, but he misses avoiding traffic and collides with an oncoming 
            driver, killing him instantly and resulting in a chain car crash. 
            Takashi continues along, and he manages to catch up with Sean, 
            ramming him over the road. Han slams the brakes, switching the 
            tables, with Sean heading on the front. Sean tries to help Han, 
            but he finds himself in front of the large Shibuya square, honking 
            to move the crowd, making a line to drift on the next corner. 
            Takashi uses the moment and pulls a 180 spin, shooting on Han's 
            windshield. Sean, noticing this, doesn't look at the traffic, and 
            another driver rear-ends him, totaling his Evo. Meanwhile, Han 
            pushes Takashi out of the road, and a oncoming car collides with 
            him, flipping him over several times. Sean tries to help him, but 
            their vehicle explodes, killing Han. Takashi then departs from the 
            scene.
            <br>
            <br>
            Horrified by this event, Sean and Neela retreat and get back to 
            where Sean's dad lives, but Takashi shows up and orders Neela to 
            get in his vehicle, and attacks Sean. Sean gets the upper hand, but 
            Takashi pulls his firearm on him. Sean's father shows up on the 
            scene, forcing Takashi to leave with Neela. Sean's father tells 
            him to retrieve his things as he is demanding to return to the 
            United States, but Sean insists on staying to make things right. 
            After some retaliation, Sean's father tells him "At least he is not 
            making his mistakes" and decides to relent. With the help of 
            Twinkie, Sean goes to the Yakuza neighborhood and returns Kamata's 
            stolen currency, which Han left to Sean proposing a race against 
            Takashi to determine who will leave Tokyo. Kamata agrees to the 
            challenge, but it will take place on DK's mountain, because he has 
            been the only one to make it down all the way.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next day, Sean and Han's friends check Han's garage, but find 
            that the Tokyo Police Department obtained all of their vehicles 
            except the one Sean crashed in first race with DK, the Silvia. Sean 
            takes the 1967 Ford Mustang GT which his dad found at his navy base 
            and remodels it with the help of Twinkie and the rest of the crew, 
            using the engine components of Han's Silvia which Sean previously 
            wrecked. The group restore the Mustang to the original shape.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the local mountain, Han's crew and Takashi's crew show up, 
            gathering signal through local video calls to watch the race. 
            Kamata shows up with Neela, while DK shows up next to Sean, who 
            waited for him. One of Kamata's goons gives the mark to start the 
            race. Although Takashi takes the lead in front, Sean passes him 
            over couple of times, to which Takashi responds by ramming him 
            multiple times, trying to scare him off the mountain road. As the 
            race progresses, Takashi almost totals his 350Z trying to stop Sean 
            from winning, but Sean gains the lead at the end of the race, 
            managing to turn on the finish line just as Takashi tries to ram 
            him, T-boning him and sending him off the cliff humiliating him and 
            winning the race. As Takashi's crew pulls him from the totaled Z, 
            Neela reunites with Sean, and Kamata lets Sean go, departing from 
            Tokyo.
            <br>
            <br>
            Months later, Sean is now the Drift King. One night, Twinkie 
            informs Sean that he has a challenger to a race who has become 
            well known around Asia. Sean declines, but Twinkie says that he 
            knew Han, and that he was family to him. Sean accepts. The 
            challenger turns out to be none other than Dominic Toretto 
            (Vin Diesel), who is driving "the Hammer", an old custom-built 
            silver 1970 Plymouth Satellite. Sean, driving a Nissan Silvia like 
            Han's - already knowing Dominic's reputation - tells him that this 
            won't be a ten second race. Dominic responds with a smile on his 
            face and says that he has nothing but time. The film ends as both 
            cars race off towards the first straight.
