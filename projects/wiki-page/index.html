            <i>canopy shyness,</i>
            <sup>[2]</sup>
            <i>or inter-crown spacing[</i>
            <sup>[3]</sup>
            ) is a phenomenon observed in some tree 
            species, in which the crowns of 
            fully stocked trees do not touch 
            each other, forming a canopy with
            channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup>
            The phenomenon is most prevalent 
            among trees of the same species, 
            but also occurs between trees of 
            different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup>
            There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might 
            inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect 
            larvae.

            The exact physiological basis of 
            crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup>
            The phenomenon has been discussed 
            in scientific literature since the 
            1920s.
            <sup>[9]</sup>
            The variety of hypotheses and 
            experimental results might suggest that 
            there are multiple mechanisms across 
            different species, an example of 
            convergent evolution 
            <i>[citation needed]</i>

            Some hypotheses contend that the 
            interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent 
            trees: trees in windy areas suffer 
            physical damage as they collide with 
            each other during winds; the abrasions 
            and collisions induce a crown shyness 
            response. Studies suggest that lateral 
            branch growth is largely uninfluenced by 
            neighbours until disturbed by mechanical 
            abrasion.
            <sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially 
            prevented from colliding in the 
            winds, they gradually fill the 
            canopy gaps.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
            This explains instances of crown 
            shyness between branches of the 
            same organism. Proponents of this 
            idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions 
            conducive to this pruning, 
            including windy forests, stands 
            of flexible trees, and early 
            succession forests where branches 
            are flexible and limited in lateral 
            movement.
            <sup>[6][12]</sup>
            According to this theory, variable 
            flexibility in lateral branches greatly 
            influences the degree of crown shyness.

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth 
            nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with 
            lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the 
            crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the 
            trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy 
            gaps.
            <sup>[13]</sup>
            Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of Picea sitchensis
            (Sitka spruce) and
            <i>Larix kaempferi</i>
            (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which 
            killed the leading shoots.
