        <h1>Pizza Rolls -Totino'S Copycat</h1>
        <p>
            These pizza rolls were a huge part 
            of my childhood — my mom always had 
            a stash ready for school lunches or 
            as an after-school snack. Think of 
            them as a homemade Totino’s copycat,
            but way better. They’re piping hot, 
            cheesy, and ooze like lava the 
            second you take a bite.

        </ul>

        <h3>FOR ASSEMBLY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                25 wonton wrappers
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>

            <br>
        </ul>
        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            
            <li><b>Make the filling:</b> In a bowl,
                mix together the 
                shredded mozzarella, pizza 
                sauce, chopped turkey 
                pepperoni, red pepper flakes, oregano, 
                parmesan, basil, and parsley until 
                everything is well combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li><b>Stuff and assemble:</b> Have a small 
                bowl of water ready for sealing. Lay out 
                the wonton wrappers in a diamond shape so 
                the corners point up, down, left, and 
                right. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon a small dollop of filling 
                (about 1 to 1 ½ teaspoons) into the 
                center of each wrapper. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip your finger in water and run it 
                along all the edges of the wrapper. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the bottom corner up over the filling
                to form a triangle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold in the left and right corners toward 
                the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then fold the top corner down and press to 
                seal everything shut like an envelope. 
                Make sure all the edges are tightly sealed
                so no filling leaks out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 350°F 
                (175°C). Once hot, carefully add the rolls 
                in batches and fry until golden brown and 
                crispy on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Remove and place on a paper towel–lined 
                plate to drain any excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot with extra pizza sauce or ranch 
                for dipping!
